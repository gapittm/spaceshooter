Project no: 6

Project due date: 12/13/17

Project description: Finish up the project with some sounds and additional features.

The easiest part of this project: Getting sound set up.

Problems that I had in completing this project: I couldn't get the reset working in time,
                  so the game is limited to one level.

  Music (Steamtech Mayhem) made by Eric Matyas
  All art assets were created by myself
